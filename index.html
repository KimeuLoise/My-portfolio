            <p>Am now a student at moringa school learning software development. The reason why I took this class is because coding is something so unique and cool. Also it's because I want to change my life and the lives of my family. Come up with ideas that can also help the nation at large. I will do this by solving problems like lack of employment for the youth, security threats on people's data like in banks, debugging, changing the technology in the nation and the mindset of people towards it</p>
